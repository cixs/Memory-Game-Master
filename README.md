# Memory Game Project

##The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.

When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again.

A restart button allows the player to **reset** the game board, the **timer** and the **star rating**.

The game displays a **star rating** (from 1 to 5) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it displays 5 stars. After some number of moves, it change to a 4 star rating. After a few more moves, it should change to a 3, 2, 1 or even 0 star rating.

When the player starts a game, a displayed **timer** start. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops. Also game displays the current **number of moves** a player has made.
